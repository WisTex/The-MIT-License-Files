# The MIT License Files

These are files that you can include in your project to comply with the MIT license (including their variations). 

These files also explain that the MIT license does not apply to the whole project. This allows you to combine the MIT license with other works, and still comply with the MIT license.

Plus, if you are ~~{lazy}~~ efficient, then including these files means you don't have to maintain a giant list of licenses (unless you want to). Just add the appropriate license files to a `licenses` subdirectory and you are fine.

## Usage

Just copy the appropriate files into your project, either into the main directory, or in a directory called `licenses` (or something similar).

For example, if you use Bootstrap in your projects, you are supposed to include the MIT License from Bootstrap. In this case, you would copy the file `LICENSE-BOOTSTRAP.txt` to your project.

If you use work from multiple MIT Licensed projects, just copy the appropriate files into your project, and you are covered. Since the names of these files don't conflict with each other, you don't have to worry about accidentally overwriting another file.

## Purpose

- [x] Make is easy to comply with MIT licenses.
- [x] Make it clear that the MIT license applies to specific works.
- [x] Serves as a handy reference if you need to find the original code again.

## Features

- [x] They have unique names so that they don't accidentally overwrite files like `LICENSE`.
- [x] A link (url) to the actual license file is included, if available online.
- [x] It includes a copy of the license in case the link (url) is not available or working.
- [x] The name of the software the license applies to is repeated, on purpose, for maximum clarity.
- [x] We don't use the generic version of the MIT License. We copy and pasted their exact version.
- [x] They are written in text format to allow users on any system to view it.
- [x] They all have a `.txt` exension so it can easily be opened on a variety of operating systems, some of which use extensions to identify file types.

## Default format:

We use the following format for most of the licenses, although some are slightly changed in cases where the author and the copyright holder are not the same entity, or for other reasons that necessitate a change.

> {name of the licensed software}
> 
> This software contains files, code, and/or documentation from {author}
> whose official website is located at: {website}
> 
> As per the license, anyone can modify and reuse {name of software} 
> subject to the terms of the license. 
> 
> If you received this software from someone other than {author}, 
> it may contain files, code, and documentation from other sources 
> that are subject to other licenses.
> 
> The portion of the software originating from or created by {author}
> is subject to the following license:
> 
> {link to license}
> 
> {a copy of their license}

## Script Creators

Feel free to adapt this for use in your own script, and include your own version of a license file in your project.

## Contributions

I have included some of the software that I have used in projects. If you have others you would like to include here, you are welcome to submit them.
